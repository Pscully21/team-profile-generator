# team-profile-generator

## Description
This project was one that was designed to help understand how tests work with JEST. Tests can be important when making sure code is being called properly in something like this project where the questions that need to be asked are reliant upon the users input. 
## Usage
to use this on your local machine first clone this repository then run ```npm i``` to install dependencies, once completed, to see the tests run ```npm run test``` and if all tests pass you can then prompt the team-profile-generator by running ```node index.js```
